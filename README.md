* open your browser and go to "http://localhost:3000" to see the project

The main "page file" is the page.tsx file, this is the file that will be rendered when you go to "http://localhost:3000".
This project is in typescript, which is pretty similar to javascript. If you are not familiar with typescript, you can still write javascript code in the typescript files.
